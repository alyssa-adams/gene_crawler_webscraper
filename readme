Before running, be sure to find the latest Firefox Gecko driver for your OS!
Save that file in the same directory as covid19.py.
Then, make a new folder in this same directory called "data".
All the scraped website data will go here.

This scraper breaks a lot because this website is a moving target, it is changing in real time.
Therefore, it makes a log file in the data folder.
The log file simply records whether or not a page was saved, or if the page broke and it didn't save.

Delete the log file if you restart the crawler, otherwise the log file will keep the old log contents.
There's a place in the code to restart where it left off, to save some time when it does break.

Updates soon!
